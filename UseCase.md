# Use Case

## Based on the type of user input, our software performs the following tasks:

1. When the user provides an AFM image that contains regions of different levels of disorder, our software has the following use cases:

* If necessary, convert the colored image to grey-scale image
* Remove background caused by natural drift
* Remove noise
* Segment disorder and ordered regions
* Visualize the ordered and disordered regions
* Provide a quantitative evaluation of the disorder-ness of the input image


2. When the user provides a set of peptide conditions, our software predicts the disorder-ness of the sample.
